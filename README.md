# Your Security Response Toolkit

This site offers a proposed collection of tools in a [**plug&play live image**](https://csirt-kit.org/#about) to provide first steps to new incident handling teams. Information on this site reflects the experience of a number of [**European CSIRTs**](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-csirt-network/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map), with tools used and supported by [**active CSIRTs**](http://tf-csirt.org/).

## CSIRT TOOLS KIT

*Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) are responsible for receiving and reviewing incident reports, and responding to them as appropriate. These services are normally performed for a defined constituency such as a corporation, institution, educational or government network, region or country, or a paid client. CSIRT services generally fall into three categories - reactive (e.g vulnerability alerts, incident handling); proactive (e.g. intrusion detection, auditing and information dissemination); and security quality management (e.g. risk analysis, disaster recovery planning, and education and training).*
