Your Security Response Toolkit
This site offers a proposed collection of tools in a plug&play live image to provide first steps to new incident handling teams. Information on this site reflects the experience of a number of European CSIRTs, with tools used and supported by active CSIRTs.

CSIRT TOOLS KIT
Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) are responsible for receiving and reviewing incident reports, and responding to them as appropriate. These services are normally performed for a defined constituency such as a corporation, institution, educational or government network, region or country, or a paid client. CSIRT services generally fall into three categories - reactive (e.g vulnerability alerts, incident handling); proactive (e.g. intrusion detection, auditing and information dissemination); and security quality management (e.g. risk analysis, disaster recovery planning, and education and training).
